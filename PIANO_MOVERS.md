# Registering a New Environment in Isaac Lab

Isaac Lab allows you to register custom environments in the Gym framework, enabling efficient use with Gym's `make` command. This guide provides steps to register a new environment, using the example of the `DirectEnvRL`-based Piano Movers environment.

---

## Environment Registration Example

The environment `DirectEnvRL` is used as the base for Piano Movers, and it is registered in the Gym environments through the `__init__.py` file. To better understand the process, you can explore the following example folder:

```
IsaacLab/source/extensions/omni.isaac.lab_tasks/omni/isaac/lab_tasks/direct/anymal_c_piano_movers
```

This folder contains the environment code and the necessary registration logic. To register your custom environment, follow these steps:

## Steps to Register a New Environment

### 1. **Modify Extensions**

If you are adding a new `DirectEnvRL` environment, place your code in the following directory:

```
IsaacLab/source/extensions/omni.isaac.lab_tasks/omni/isaac/lab_tasks/direct/
```

### 2. **Update `__init__.py`**

Ensure that your new environment is registered in the Gym framework by adding the appropriate registration logic to the `__init__.py` file in the corresponding directory.

### 3. **Reinstall the Extensions Package**

After making changes to the extensions, you need to reinstall the `omni.isaac.lab_tasks` package. Use the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/extensions/omni.isaac.lab_tasks/
```

This command updates the extension for Isaac Sim, ensuring your changes are properly registered.

## Running the Registered Environment

To run a script that uses the newly registered environment, you must use the NVIDIA-provided `isaaclab.sh` script. Hereâ€™s an example command for running the Piano Movers environment:

```bash
./isaaclab.sh -p source/isaacdev/envs/piano_movers_direct_env.py
```

Replace `piano_movers_direct_env.py` with the path to your environment script.

---

## Summary

- **Location of Environment Code**:
  - `IsaacLab/source/extensions/omni.isaac.lab_tasks/omni/isaac/lab_tasks/direct/`
- **Reinstall Extensions**:
  - `python -m pip install -e source/extensions/omni.isaac.lab_tasks/`
- **Run the Environment**:
  - `./isaaclab.sh -p <path_to_your_script>`

By following these steps, you can successfully register and run your custom environments in Isaac Lab.
